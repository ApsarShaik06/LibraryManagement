# LibraryManagement
This Library Management System project simulates how a library operates by handling book inventory, issuing and returning books to students, and managing the library's book count. 
The project is divided into three main classes:

Student: Manages individual students and their interactions with books (issuing, returning, displaying issued books).
Library: Handles the book inventory, adding/removing books, and tracking the availability of books.
Main: Manages the systemâ€™s overall operation, including admin and student login, interaction with the library, and menu-driven interfaces for user operations.
