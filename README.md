# LibraryManagement
This Library Management System project simulates how a library operates by handling book inventory, issuing and returning books to students, and managing the library's book count. 
The project is divided into three main classes:

Student: Manages individual students and their interactions with books (issuing, returning, displaying issued books).

Library: Handles the book inventory, adding/removing books, and tracking the availability of books.

Main: Manages the systemâ€™s overall operation, including admin and student login, interaction with the library, and menu-driven interfaces for user operations.

Features:
----------
Admin functions: Add/Remove books, view available books, manage students.

Student functions: Issue/return books and view their issued books.

Book limits: A student can issue a maximum of two books at a time.

Book availability check: The system checks if a book is available before issuing it.

Interactive menu system: The system provides an interactive text-based menu for both admin and students to navigate through different options.
